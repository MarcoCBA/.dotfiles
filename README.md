# Marco Martinelli's dotfiles

### Description

This repository contains my personal configs and apps for Macbooks PCs.
They are mostly cherry picked from different repositories, so if you see something you created, thanks and credits to you!

### About code structure.
I tried to make it as organized as possible.
- Required homebrew apps are specified in text files.
- MacOS enviroment settings and others, are placed in separate configuration scripts.
- Runcom files such as .zshrc and gitrc are placed together
Before changing anything try finding usages:
```bash
grep -irn "tool" *
```
